title: Quick, Draw! - a game where a neural net tries to guess what you're drawing.
abstract: This is a game built with machine learning. You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what you're drawing. Of course, it doesnâ€™t always work. But the more you play with it, the more it will learn. It's just one example of how you can use machine learning in fun ways.
