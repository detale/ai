title: Shadow Art - Try your hands at the ancient art of shadow puppetry, with a little help from AI.
abstract: Create shadow puppets with your hands in front of your laptop or phone camera. The puppets correspond to one of the lunar cycle’s 12 zodiac symbols, and a TensorFlow model identifies which animal your hands are forming. Get it right within the time limit, and you’re given the next zodiac symbol to try, with the ultimate goal of completing all 12.
