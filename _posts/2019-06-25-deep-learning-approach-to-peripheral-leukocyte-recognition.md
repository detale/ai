title: "Deep learning approach to peripheral leukocyte recognition"
abstract: "The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper, we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply ..."
