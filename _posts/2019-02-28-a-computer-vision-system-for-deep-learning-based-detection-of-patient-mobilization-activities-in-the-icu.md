title: "A computer vision system for deep learning-based detection of patient mobilization activities in the ICU"
abstract: "Early and frequent patient mobilization substantially mitigates risk for post-intensive care syndrome and long-term functional impairment. We developed and tested computer vision algorithms to detect patient mobilization activities occurring in an adult ICU."
