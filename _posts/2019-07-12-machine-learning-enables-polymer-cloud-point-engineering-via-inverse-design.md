title: "Machine learning enables polymer cloud-point engineering via inverse design"
abstract: "Inverse design is an outstanding challenge in disordered systems with multiple length scales such as polymers, particularly when designing polymers with desired phase behavior. Here we demonstrate high-accuracy tuning of poly(2-oxazoline) cloud point via ..."
