title: "Natural hypothalamic circuit dynamics underlying object memorization"
abstract: "Here we show that targeted optogenetic silencing of these signals, performed selectively during the initial object encounters (i.e. memory acquisition), prevents future recognition of the objects. We identify an upstream inhibitory microcircuit from ..."
