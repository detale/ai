title: "Deep Learning for the Radiographic Detection of Periodontal Bone Loss"
abstract: "We applied deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect periodontal bone loss (PBL) on panoramic dental radiographs. We synthesized a set of 2001 image segments from panoramic radiographs. Our reference test was the measured % of PBL. A deep feed ..."
