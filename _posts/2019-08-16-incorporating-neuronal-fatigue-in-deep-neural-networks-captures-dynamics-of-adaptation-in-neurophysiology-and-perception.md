title: "Incorporating neuronal fatigue in deep neural networks captures dynamics of adaptation in neurophysiology and perception"
abstract: "Furthermore, adapting to prevailing but irrelevant inputs improves object recognition and the adaptation computations can be trained in a network trained to maximize recognition performance. These results show that an intrinsic fatigue mechanism can ..."
