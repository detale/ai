title: "A Comparison of Deep Neural Networks for Seizure Detection in EEG Signals"
abstract: "We employ two approaches based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to provide a probability of seizure occurrence in a windowed EEG recording of 18 channels. In order to extract relevant features based on time ..."
